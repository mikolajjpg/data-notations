## Laptop

A [laptop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop) is a portable computer that combines a screen, keyboard, and internal components like a processor and storage into a compact, foldable design. It runs on battery power, making it ideal for mobile use at home, work, or on the go.

Modern laptops offer features like high-resolution displays, fast solid-state drives, and wireless connectivity. They’re used for everything from browsing and writing to gaming and professional tasks.

Laptops come in several types based on size, performance, and purpose. [Ultrabooks](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrabook) are slim, lightweight, and designed for portability and battery life, making them ideal for students and professionals on the go. They often feature solid-state drives and energy-efficient processors.

Gaming laptops are built for performance, with powerful GPUs, high-refresh-rate displays, and advanced cooling systems. They're heavier and bulkier but handle demanding tasks like video editing and 3D rendering with ease. Some even support external GPU docks for extra power.

2-in-1 laptops, also known as convertibles or hybrids, combine the features of a laptop and a tablet. They have touchscreens and hinges that allow the screen to rotate or detach, offering flexibility for drawing, note-taking, or media consumption.

Laptop hardware refers to the physical components that make up a laptop and enable it to function. These include internal parts like the processor (CPU), memory (RAM), storage drives, and graphics processing unit (GPU), as well as external elements such as the keyboard, screen, and touchpad. Each component plays a specific role—for example, the CPU handles all processing tasks, while RAM temporarily stores data for quick access. Together, these parts work in harmony to run software, manage files, and perform everyday computing tasks.

Modern laptops are designed to balance performance with portability, so their hardware is often compact and energy-efficient. Components like solid-state drives (SSDs) have replaced traditional hard drives in many models, offering faster data access and improved durability. Cooling systems, batteries, and wireless modules are also essential, ensuring the laptop stays functional and connected while on the move.

#### Main Laptop Hardware Components:

1.Central Processing Unit [(CPU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit) – The brain of the laptop that handles all instructions and operations.

2.Random Access Memory [(RAM)](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAM) – Temporary memory that stores data for active tasks and applications.

3.Storage Drive (HDD or SSD) – Stores the operating system, software, and user files.

4.Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) – Renders images, videos, and animations; crucial for gaming and design work.

5.Motherboard – The main circuit board that connects all hardware components and allows them to communicate.
